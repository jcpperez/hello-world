# hello-world
Journal my progress of Python Learning.
I will register my daily learnings, my questions
Review my own knowledge and make small notes to 
Myself. 

**Remember set() will chose the unique Items in a
List [] and iterate over the list returning unique
Values 

Example

mylist = [1,2,2,2,2,4,4,5,5]
set(mylist)
Print [1,2,4,5]
