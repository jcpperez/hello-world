# hello-world
Journal my progress of Python Learning.
I will register my daily learnings, my questions
Review my own knowledge and make small notes to 
Myself. 

**Remember set() will chose the unique Items in a
List [] and iterate over the list returning unique
Values 

Example

mylist = [1,2,2,2,2,4,4,5,5]
set(mylist)
Print [1,2,4,5]

To find out what attributes a type has:

dir(str)
dir(list)
dir(dict)
To find out what Python builtin functions there are:

dir(__builtins__)
Documentation for a Python command can be found with:

help(str)
help(str.replace)
help(dict.values)
